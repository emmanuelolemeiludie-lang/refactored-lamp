# AI Automation Dashboard

## Project Idea
This project aims to create an AI automation dashboard that can process data, run AI models, and generate reports efficiently. It will have a modular structure with scripts for automation, notebooks for experimentation, and a reporting system for visualization.

## Folder Structure
- **data/**: Stores raw and processed data.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for automation tasks.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for testing and prototyping.
- **reports/**: Visualizations and AI outputs.

## How to Use
1. Place your data files in the `data/` folder.
2. Run scripts from the `scripts/` folder.
3. Explore AI experiments in `notebooks/`.
4. View outputs and visualizations in `reports/`.
